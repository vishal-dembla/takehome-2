        <h2>Why Understanding Take-Home Salary Matters</h2>
        <p>When negotiating jobs or planning finances, it’s critical to look beyond CTC headlines. Focus on what truly reaches your account — your <strong>monthly in-hand salary</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>Ready to Know Your Estimated Take-Home?</h2>
        <p>This article gives you general estimates. But your actual <strong>in-hand salary depends on your specific CTC, deductions, and tax regime choice.</strong></p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Why is my take-home less than my CTC?</strong><br>Because your <strong>CTC includes non-cash benefits and deductions</strong> like employer's PF contribution, gratuity, insurance, and taxes.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Does Old vs. New Tax Regime impact my take-home?</strong><br>Yes. From ₹8L upwards, the <strong>New Regime often offers better take-home</strong> unless you have significant deductions like a housing loan or maxed-out 80C investments.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Are bonuses included in this table?</strong><br>No. This only shows <strong>fixed monthly salaries</strong>, excluding performance bonuses or incentives.</p>
        <p><strong>4. How can I get a good estimate?</strong><br>Use a detailed <a href="index.html"><strong>take-home salary calculator</strong></a> that <strong>factors in the tax regime, PF choices, and your location</strong> to provide a realistic breakdown.</p>
