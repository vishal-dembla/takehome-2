        <h1>About This Tool</h1>

        <p>The <strong>Take-Home Salary Calculator for India</strong> was created with one simple goal: To help you calculate your <strong>take-home salary, CTC breakdown, and in-hand pay</strong> clearly, quickly, and without confusion.</p>
        <p>Having spent 19+ years in recruiting — working across startups, large enterprises, and executive search — I’ve seen how many people struggle with something as basic as understanding their salary. Between <strong>CTC structures, tax deductions, EPF, HRA, metro allowances, rent, and the old vs. new tax regimes</strong>, figuring out your <strong>monthly take-home salary</strong> often becomes more complicated than it should be.</p>
        <p>This tool simplifies all of that. You input your details. The calculator handles the logic.</p>

        <section id="ai-built">
            <h2>Built Using AI — Not Hidden Behind AI</h2>
            <p>This tool was built with the help of <strong>Google AI Studio and ChatGPT</strong>, combining the power of modern AI with practical, human-centered design. The goal was to create something useful, transparent, and free — without forcing you into an app, login, or subscription.</p>
            <p>Everything runs on your browser. Your data stays with you.</p>

        <section id="who-i-am">
            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishaldembla1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vishal Dembla</strong></a>, a recruiter, builder, and advocate for practical tools that make life easier. Over two decades, I’ve led hiring across industries — from <strong>CXO leadership searches to high-volume staffing</strong>. I’ve worked with over 500 companies, advised founders, and even built one of India’s earliest resume tools.</p>
            <p>I believe the best tools don’t hide behind paywalls. They solve real problems, simply and openly.</p>

        <section id="why-it-matters">
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>This isn’t just about salary math. It’s about clarity. It’s about empowering you to make smarter decisions in your career — whether that’s accepting a new job, negotiating your next offer, or just understanding where your money really goes.</p>
            <p>Every minute saved here is time you can spend on what matters more: your career, your goals, your peace of mind.</p>
            <p>Let’s build more tools like this — useful, open, and focused on helping people, not extracting value from them.</p>
