## What It Does

This tool helps professionals in India get a realistic estimate of their take-home (or in-hand) salary from a given Cost to Company (CTC). It eliminates the confusion around salary components by:

*   Breaking down your CTC into estimated earnings and deductions.
*   Comparing the impact of the Old vs. New tax regimes on your pay.
*   Providing clarity on how PF contributions affect your final salary.
*   Helping you set realistic financial expectations from a job offer.

## Why This Exists

The salary structure in India is often confusing. A high CTC figure on an offer letter rarely translates to the expected monthly credit in your bank account. This tool was created to bridge that gap and demystify the core components of a salary slip — from Provident Fund (PF) and Professional Tax to HRA and tax regime choices — so you can understand where your money really goes.

## Features

*   Separate toggle buttons for **Old vs. New Tax Regime**.
*   Option to select **Metro vs. Non-Metro** city to estimate HRA impact.
*   Choice between **Statutory vs. Full Basic** PF contribution.
*   Instant calculation of both **Annual & Monthly Take-Home Salary**.
*   A detailed **Earnings & Deductions Breakdown** table.
*   Full educational guide explaining all salary components integrated on the page.
*   Clean, minimalist UI with no ads or tracking.

## Example Output
